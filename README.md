# Library-management

The Library Management System (LMS) is a console-based application built with Python and backed by a MySQL database. It is designed to efficiently manage the day-to-day operations of a small to medium-sized library, handling book inventory, member records, and borrowing/return transactions, including fine calculation and report generation. The system emphasizes a user-friendly, color-coded interface using the colorama library.
